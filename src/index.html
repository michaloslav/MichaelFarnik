              <b>JavaScript</b> - 
              I've been working with in this language for almost 5 years. ES6+ JavaScript is as natural as English to me at this point.

            <div class="item">
              <b>React</b> - 
              My main specialty. I absolutely love this framework and have built huge projects with it.
              I also love its ecosystem, with things like Redux and Redux-Saga being a part of almost everything I do.

            <div class="item">
              <b>Vue</b> - 
              The community around it is still lacking which is why I prefer React 
              but I think Vue will eventually prevail as the one framework to rule them all - the features are just too good.

            <div class="item">
              <b>Design</b> - 
              I'm a minimalist at heart and it shows in my work. I love designing simple, intuitive UIs and improving UX until it reaches perfection.

            <div class="item">
              <b>Express</b> - 
              Express is really the most natural way to build APIs for me. It's usually my go-to choice for anything server-side

            <div class="item">
              <b>SQL & NoSQL</b> -

        About me
      </div>
      <p>
        My journey on the web started when I was 8 years old. That's when I learned the basics of HTML, CSS and programming... 
        and then promptly forgot literally everything I had learned. But I still think those beginnings taught me to think like a programmer.
      </p>
      <p>
        I really got serious about software at the age of 14. I downloaded some apps that taught me the basics of JavaScript, Python and other languages
        and just started playing around with them. I made games, websites, web servers, even some very basic machine learning and AI stuff.
        It was a whole new world to me at the time and I was fascinated by it. I felt completely lost in the sea of tech, tools and terms 
        but slowly began to get the gist of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I gradually started to realize just how much I loved web development. It just felt like the most natural thing ever to me and I knew that
        this was what I wanted to do. So I started learning about frameworks, test tools, build tools and everything else, all while perfecting my knowledge
        of JavaScript even further. I found React and fell in love with it, an affection that still hasn't worn off. I also started reading about Vue which
        quickly became my favorite for smaller projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        I finally feel like I understand the field now and it is the greatest feeling ever. 
      </p>
      <P>
        I have no clue where I will go from here or what I will build next.
        All I know is how thankful I am that I found something that truly fulfills me this early on in life.
