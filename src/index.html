              <b>JavaScript</b> - 
              I've been working with in this language for almost 5 years and it has just become the most natural way to code for me
            </div>
            <div class="item">
              <b>React</b> - 
              This is my main area of expertise. I always do everything I can to be ahead of the curve when it comes to React and its ecosystem
              and to learn about all the new features as soon as they're announced.
            </div>
            <div class="item">
              <b>UI/UX</b> - 
              Designing, implementing and perfecting the way users interact with my apps is one of my favorite parts of development.
              I think that little things about UI make all the difference and you can never spend too much time on them.

            <div class="item">
              <b>Vue</b> - 
              I think this framework has huge potential and I'm definitely planning on doing more work with it to see how it scales.
              Its community is still a bit lacking though which is why I prefer React overall

              <b>Express</b> - 
              For me, Express is just the easiest thing to build APIs with. It's usually my go-to choice for anything server-side
            </div>
            <div class="item">
              <b>SQL & NoSQL</b> - 
              I usually use NoSQL systems (because they're just so good) but I've worked with MySQL too. 
              Combine that with something like GraphQL and you get the perfect API

              <b>System architecture</b> -

            My journey on the web started when I was 8 years old. That's when I learned the basics of HTML, CSS and programming... 
            and then promptly forgot everything I had learned. But I still think those beginnings taught me a lot about thinking like a programmer.
          </p>
          <p>
            I really got serious about software at the age of 14. I downloaded some apps that taught me the basics of JavaScript, Python and other languages
            and just started playing around with them. I wrote games, websites, web servers, even some basic machine learning and AI.
            It was a whole new world to me at the time and I was fascinated by it. I felt completely lost at first 
            but then slowly began to get the hang of it which felt great.
          </p>
          <p>
            I gradually started to realize how much I enjoyed web development in particular. It felt really natural to me and I came to realize that
            that was what I wanted to do. So I started learning about frameworks, testing tools, build tools and everything else, all while still improving
            my knowledge of JavaScript. I found React and quickly started to like its workflow and principles. I also started reading about Vue which
            quickly became my favorite for smaller projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course no one can ever completely understand all of software development. I still have a lot to learn and I always will have.
            But I finally feel like I get the gist of it now and like all the hard work has finally paid off.
